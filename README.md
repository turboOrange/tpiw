# tpiw
A password manager backend using microservices (TPIY -> the password in yellow)

## idea
- python
- fastapi
- redis
- postgres
- no orm (Might chagne later if I decide that it's worth becoming a real thing. For now it's to practice)
- No UI but UI ready
- support username, password and 2fa 
- support multiple users
- try to build so premium and freemium users can exist in the futur
